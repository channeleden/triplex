# Agent Instructions & Context

## 1. Project Context
You are working in an **intentional clone** of the Triplex repository.
**Project Name**: triplex-rosebleed

**Do not** attempt to merge this back into the main repo or worry about it being a duplicate. This environment is isolated for specific viewing/customization of this version.

## 2. Backup Requirement
Any new effects or components you create must be backed up to the central backup location.

**Backup Path**:
`/Users/baileeeden/Documents/web-assets/fresh-backups/GitHub/channel-core-concepts/effects/triplex-rosebleed`

Before starting work:
1. Ensure this backup folder exists (it should have been created already).
2. When you finish a component, copy the relevant files there.

## 3. Workflow
- You have full permission to modify this codebase significantly to match the theme of this version.
- Use `pnpm` for package management.
